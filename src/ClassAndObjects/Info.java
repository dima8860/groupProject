    /*
    Java allows us to create objects in  computer using classes.
    Class --> type or blueprint for an object.

    Datatypes in Java

    1.Primitive --> ONLY allows ONE piece of information;
        Ex: int i = 6;

    2.Object ---> allows to store different information;
        -> Object datatypes are able to store many pieces of information
        -> Object types(datatypes) are able to store not only pieces of information but they can store also behaviors of information.

        We can create Objects using classes:
        1.First we have to create a class and set the rules for it.
        2.Create an object from it.

        EX:
        String name = "James";
        name.indexOf("m");


        *Class has two things
        1.Data fields, attributes, instance variables, properties;
        2. Behaviors, methods.

        EX:

        public class Dog {

            String name;  // These all are instance variables. or Data fields, attributes, instance variables, properties;
            int age;
            String color;
            double weight;
            String breed;

            public void bark() {
            System.out.println("Dog is barking");
            }

        }

        Class vs Object

        *Class is the type that specifies the instance variables and behaviors. WE can say that class is a template or blueprint.

        *Object: an actual object that got created be the class.
        Multiple objects can be created by one class.

        Creating an Object:
        - We use 'new' keyword every time we create an object.
        ex: Flag f1 = new Flag();
        - instantiate --> create an object.
        - object == instance.  is the same.

        *** By default when we have local variable same as instance variable, it uses local variable within the method.

        Check if an object null
        if (name.name  == null)

        Mouse m1 = new Mouse ();
        Mouse m2 = new Mouse();

        Mouse m3  = m1;
        m2 = m1;
