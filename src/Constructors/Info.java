       -> Constructor is a special method (kind like a method) that invoke every time we create an object
       => does not have return type
       => has same name as a class
       => it case sensitive;
       => it creates an object
       => Do we have to create a constructor?
       => if we don't create it then java creates one for you.
       => you don't see one if you don't create one.
       => Because by default constructor is hidden. But it's there.

       ==> What kind of code can be used in constructor?
       - To set initial state of object.

       if programmer doesn't create constructor then java creates it. And it called default constructor.
       Default constructor is hidden and it doesn't take any argument

       However, we can create a constructor that can take some arguments. And we can use those arguments (parameters) to set initial  value
       for a newly created object.

       If you create one constructor yourself no more default constructor will be created by java.
