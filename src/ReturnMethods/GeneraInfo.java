        Return type methods
        Methods give a single value back to the user; one piece of information, one number( cant give you 2 numbers or 2 arrays);
        Methods do not store information;
        The value given back should match the datatype that is provided in the method declaration;
        instead of void keyword we need to have the datatype that we expect the method to give us back;
        Keyword: return
        return type method needs to use this keyword to give a lavue
        without this return statement there will be a syntax error
        return statement value needs to match the datatype given as the return type of the method;
        after execution a return statement the methods ends
        any code after a return statement is unreachable


        Syntax:
        public static int getThree() {
        return 3;
        }
        public static void main(String [] args) {
        int a  = getThree();
        }

         */
    }
}
