        Methods

        2 perspectives:

        1. Creating methods;
        Ex: When creating a utility classes you create your own methods.

        What do we need from user?
        -size of the random numbers;

        What user wants from us?
        - random numbers up to 1000 list size of given size;

        method welcomeUser.

        What do we need from user?
        - user name and last;

        What does user want from us?
        - just show good welcomeUser(String firstName,

        2. Using methods:
        Ex: Whenever you use any methods in your programming.
        Arrays.sort() is using someone's methods.
        String manipulation methods: length(), substring , indexOf(), charAt().

        You look at 2 things when using/calling/invoking the methods.

        a. What does the method take?
        b. What does the method return?

        Ex: String name = "Jason";
        name.charAt(2);
        char c = name.charAt(2);

        Arrays.sort(arr);
